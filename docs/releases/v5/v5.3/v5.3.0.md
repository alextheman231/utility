# v5.3.0 (Minor Release)

<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-status -->
**Status**: Released

<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way and should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read the description of changes below.
<!-- alex-c-line-end-release-summary -->

## Description of Changes

- Add a `ONE_DAY_IN_MILLISECONDS` constant.
    - This will be used to help with `alex-c-line`'s update notifications as I start bringing them in-house.
    - Because JavaScript Date insists on us doing time calculations by milliseconds, it makes it much easier to be able to refer to this instead.

## Additional Notes

- I am absolutely deprecating this constant the moment Temporal comes out.
- I hate the fact that I have to add this because JavaScript Date is trash.
- Temporal support for Node when? Please!
