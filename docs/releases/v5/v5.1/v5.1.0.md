<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way and should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read the description of changes below.
<!-- alex-c-line-end-release-summary -->

## Description of Changes

- Move `parseFilePath` to the `node` entrypoint.
    - Since it uses `node:path` internally, it must be exported from that entrypoint.

## Migration Notes

- Replace the import path from the root entrypoint to that of the Node entrypoint wherever `parseFilePath` is being exported.

Before:
```typescript
import { parseFilePath } from "@alextheman/utility";
```

After:
```typescript
import { parseFilePath } from "@alextheman/utility/node";
```
