## Description of Changes

- Add `additionalDependencies` option to `setupPackageEndToEnd`.
    - It allows installing specific dependencies (e.g. peer dependencies like eslint) before installing the packaged tarball.
    - This may be needed to fix a peer dependency issue with the ESLint plugin end-to-end tests (which may also be an issue for consumers at the moment, but I am looking into this right now.)
    - It is an internal function, so no further action necessary.
