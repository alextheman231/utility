## Description of Changes

- Adds some new internal helpers to the internal entrypoint.
    - I won't document them all as they are mainly internal, but the big one is `setupPackageEndToEnd`.
    - That allows us to re-use the initial setup logic for our end-to-end tests across all repositories without needing to duplicate.
    - In the end-to-end tests, all package repositories are expected to:
        - Pack a tarball into the temporary directory.
        - Set up a temporary package.json.
        - Install the tarball into the project (either under `dependencies` or `devDependencies`).
    - All this logic has been standardised in `setupPackageEndToEnd`.
