## Description of Changes

- Add a `zodVersionNumber` so we can more easily use the `VersionNumber` class in Zod schemas.
    - This will accept any valid string, tuple of three numbers, or `VersionNumber` instance in a Zod schema.
    - It helps to reduce the amount of steps needed when trying to parse a version number in a Zod schema, so we don't need to keep specifying `z.string()` then manually passing the parsed result the `VersionNumber` constructor afterwards.
