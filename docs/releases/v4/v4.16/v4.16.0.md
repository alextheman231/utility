<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way and should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read the description of changes below.

## Description of Changes

- Add an `IsTypeArgumentString` type that constrains the type argument to `string`.
    - Not really a super useful one, but it helps in the entrypoints/module resolution test as a simple type to check that types resolve correctly.

## Additional Notes

- Speaking of, that test has been refactored quite a bit since I added it.
- It now only runs by default in CI in its own job - it will never run in the main test run, so you'll instead have to invoke it separately with `pnpm run test-end-to-end`.
- On top of that, mainly a few quality of life changes to make the code more readable, as well as that added type resolution check I mentioned above.
- Seriously, though, you cannot convince me that that test suite is not the coolest test suite in this organisation!
