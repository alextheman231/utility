## Description of Changes

- Make the second type argument of `parseZodSchema` default to `DataError`.
    - Since this is what we throw by default, I think this default type argument makes the most sense to me.
    - This allows the caller to only pass in a `SchemaType` without also being forced to pass in an `ErrorType`.
