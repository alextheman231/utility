<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way and should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read the description of changes below.

## Description of Changes

- Adds a `sayHello` function
    - Just a fun little Easter egg that logs the lyrics to this package's theme song, Commit To You [(please give it a listen!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mH-Sg-8EnxM)


## Additional Notes

- It also adds one of the coolest test suites I have ever come up with!
    - Trust me, it's VERY cool!
    - It basically goes through and verifies that the package properly resolves in the environments that we support!
    - I think it's a really nice test to have, even if a little slow, as it catches any potential misconfigurations at the test level, long before it even gets deployed.
    - It's the closest this package will get in testing spirit to an `alex-c-line` style test, and I mean that in the best possible way!
    - Yeah, how many other packages can boast that they literally test their entrypoints like that? Probably not many!
    - But it's also not really a feature of the package itself that consumers need to worry about, hence why this is under additional notes.
    - Still, though, really pleased with this one, to be honest!
