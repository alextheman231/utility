## Description of Changes

- Test release to try out the new change to the `commit-version-change` workflow
    - This will now also generate the feature documentation so that we no longer have two different pull requests doing this.

## Additional Notes

- This release should mean nothing to consumers of the package as it does not touch source code.
- The last release that touched source code is [v4.12.2](https://github.com/alextheman231/utility/releases/tag/v4.12.2)
- The last release that actually added a meaningful change is [v4.12.0](https://github.com/alextheman231/utility/releases/tag/v4.12.0)
