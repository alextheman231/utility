<!-- alex-c-line-start-release-summary -->
This is a new minor release of the `@alextheman/utility` package. It introduces new features in a backwards-compatible way and should require very little refactoring, if any. Please read the description of changes below.

## Description of Changes

- Adds support for an optional increment amount in `new VersionNumber().increment()` as an optional second argument.
    - This allows us to increment version numbers by more than just one, or potentially even decrement it if a negative version is provided.
    - Note that if, when decrementing, we ever reach a negative version number, it would not be allowed and hence an error will be thrown.

## Additional Notes

- This is particularly useful in tests if you want to do more involved version calculations.
- In my case, I'm bringing update-notifications in-house for `alex-c-line` and need a way to decrement the version so that we can test cases where the current version is lower than the latest version from `npm view`.
